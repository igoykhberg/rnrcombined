# Scope

program consists of 3 parts: frontend (react) backend (express) and redis
the reason redis was selected is for its simplicity and key-values handled as JSON strings
(in production would of course use additional database)

# Run

- $ docker compose up
- visit: [http://localhost:4173/] (might load slower with edge, better use chrome or firefox)
